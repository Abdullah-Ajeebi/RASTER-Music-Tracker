Hi,

as a member of Olomouc Atari Club, I started some work on Rmt. I am not a musician myself, so my knowledge of Rmt is still limited,
but I want to keep the Rmt alive and I think in order to achieve this, it must be actively developed.

I got contact to you from LiSU, who told me, you would probably be interested in testing the new version of Rmt.
You can download beta of a new version (just .exe) from http://rmt.kutululu.org.
Currently, we mainly want to update user interface, maybe add some functions/tools.
No modification of player or format of module yet.

I also founded a group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rmtracker where we will be able to discuss Rmt.

Please, let me know, if you are interested in new development of Rmt.

Have a nice day,

Rudla Kudla
