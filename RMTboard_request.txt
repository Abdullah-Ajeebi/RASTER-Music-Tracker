amazing :) my second request is a random instrument generator.
could this be done ? for experimentation`s sake ! like when you press "ctrl+r" - it randoms instrument parameters. could be usefull. Thanks !

New RMT 1.15 tracker is out. See the file changes.txt to know all the changes. Enjoy it! :-)

wakax: Hm, It would be possible to add such function sometime in future. But I advise you to make wav output currently by Atari800WinPLus emulator (export RMT song as XEX MSX program and run it under this emulator) - it has much much more accurate POKEY sound emulation.

any chance to make it dump in .wav ? from file menu ?
Thanks.
