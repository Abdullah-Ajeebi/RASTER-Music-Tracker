Hi Raster,

I consider distributing apokeysnd.dll with other Windows binaries of ASAP.
But since it will take some time before the next release and to make the 
download easier for RMT users, I will also keep the latest version 
always available at:
http://asap.sourceforge.net/apokeysnd.dll

I have just updated the DLL at the above URL to match the latest CVS 
version.
Last changes only slightly improve SKCTL emulation (INIT and two-tone mode).

Greetings,
0xF
