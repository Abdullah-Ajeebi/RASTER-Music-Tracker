-----------

Freedom - from a chiptune by grim/digital. spent ages listening to this one (probably because it was used on the Fairlight version of Frontier - elite 2 which had 100+ options and took a while to set up from the trainer screen)


Mayonaise.rmt
-------------

Mayonaise by the Smashing Pumpkins (from the album Siamese Dream). just a great song iz all.


Monty.rmt
---------

Monty on the run high score theme. Originally by Rob Hubbard.

part (IMHO the best part) of the intro music by Martin Galway.

Because of the lack of drums you really need a bassline with a bit of a kick to it. This is where the 'horrible distortion' of the POKEY people keep trying to supress actually becomes an advantage.

Told him I hated this song because it just buries itself into your brain and NOTHING will remove it. I *like* the song - I'd just like it more if I could walk down a quiet street 4 hours later and NOT be humming it :)
